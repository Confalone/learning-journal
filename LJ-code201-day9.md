just realized i forgot the .md on day 7 and 8; hope that is not a problem

overall i am feeling more comfortable with git and really everything, but still very uncertain of everything

still cannot figure out what is wrong on 2 lines of my lab code, with out these working i cannot test to see if the rest of my code is working

loving the struggle, staying positive

today is going to be a good day
