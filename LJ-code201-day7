really enjoying the frustration, feeling like i should be further than i am

the two parts of lab three flagged by my linter have been driving me crasy for 3 days now

trying to stay positive and trust the process just feel being stuck week 1 is not a good sign; plus feel like im wasting my time right now trying to figure out what is wrong as opposed to continuing to learn other things.  

not sure if my approach is off

fun times though
