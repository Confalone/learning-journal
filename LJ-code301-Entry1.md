Sorry for this being my first entry I had not realized that this was going to be a requirement for 301 like it was for 201.  I do enjoy the reflection. 
Week1 was great, I feel like I always do, that I know nowthing, but thats drinking from a fire hose.  I am enjoying the structure of 301 so far, I know its week2 but still.  

I am really starting to enjoy the concept of jQuery,  I know nothing about it yet, but I feel that I can really see the potential it owns.
