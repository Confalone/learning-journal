Journal Day 24

I cannot believe its day 24, I look back and can see I ahve learned some stuff, but feel like i have only accomplished 1 mile in a marathon.  

I signed up for tutoring, hoping that can help

I am not evn sure if i can work on my projects till I get my other ones back, that shows how lost I am.   Oh well, IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
